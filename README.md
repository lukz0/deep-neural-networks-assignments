Assignments in the course deep neural networks course: https://web.archive.org/web/20220111123947/https://www.uia.no/studieplaner/topic/IKT450-G
My main project consisted of trying different GANs for image generation, but the course also included many small assignments where less effort was expected with topics like CNNs, autoencoders, recurrent neural networks and NLP.
Small assignments were done on a GeForce GTX 970 with 4GB of memory or a CPU.
